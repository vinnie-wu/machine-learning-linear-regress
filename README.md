# Machine Learning: Linear Regressor
This project is completed from ELEC 400M at UBC (Dr. XiaoXiao Li), using a linear regressor model to forecast future model. 

For project details, please see 'HW1.pdf'. The project is written in **python** for data analytics, and **graphical data** are *visualized* with ***matplotlib***

Some main libraries used:
- numpy
- pandas
- csv
- statistics
- matplotlib
- sklearn

To run the code, please have Jupyter notebook environment installed. The code is completely procedural, meaning it can be ran completley sequentially.
